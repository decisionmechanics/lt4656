## Section 1: Introduction to Version Control

### Key Concepts of Version Control

- **Version Control**: A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing you to revert to specific versions later.
- **Version Control System (VCS)**: Tracks the history of changes as files evolve. Enables collaborative work on projects and safekeeping of historical versions.

### Why Version Control?

- **Change Tracking**: Keeps a record of who made which changes and why, crucial for collaborative projects.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates multiple people working on the same project, even on the same files, without losing work.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Offers a backup of work and an easy way to revert to previous states in case of errors or unwanted changes.
- **Data Management**: Allows tracking of experiments, including changes in data, code, and models.

### Version Control beyond Software Development

- **Data vs. Code**: Data-driven projects (and game development) often involve large datasets alongside code, requiring effective handling of both.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that data analysis is reproducible requires careful tracking of data, code, and computational environments.
- **Collaboration Challenges**: Large project teams may include diverse roles such as data engineers, analysts, scientists and technical writers each with different needs and workflows.
- **Documentation**: May include less technical team members.

### Overview of Git

- **Git**: A distributed version control system, [widely used](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/09/beyond-git-the-other-version-control-systems-developers-use/) in software development, known for its efficiency and flexibility.
- **Centralised vs. Distributed VCS**: Centralised systems store all versions in a single central repository, while distributed systems like Git allow each user to have a complete copy of the repository.
- **Popular**: Git is popular due to its robustness, support for non-linear development (branching), and widespread community adoption.

### Best Practices when Using Git

- Regularly commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
- Sync with remote repositories frequently to stay updated.
- Use branching for experimental features or analyses.

## Section 2: Installation of Git

### Overview of Git Installation

- **Git Download**: Git can be downloaded from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).
- **Installation Process**: Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### Configuring Git for the First Time

- **Setting Up User Information**:
  - Use `git config` to set your username: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  - Set your email address with: `git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"`
- **Checking Configuration**:
  - Verify configuration using: `git config --list`
- **Additional Configuration**:
  - Other configurations may include setting up text editors or managing line endings.

### Understanding the Git Environment

- **Git Terminal/Command Line**: Most Git operations are performed through the command line or terminal.
- **Basic Commands Overview**: Familiarise with basic Git commands like `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, and `git commit`.
- **Git GUI Tools**: Introduction to GUI tools like GitKraken or SourceTree for those who prefer a graphical interface.

### Tips for Beginners

- **Practice**: Experiment with basic commands in a test repository to get comfortable with the Git workflow.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the Git documentation for detailed guidance on various commands and operations.
- **Community Resources**: Utilise online forums, communities, and tutorials for additional learning and troubleshooting.

## Section 3: Basic Git Commands

### Checking the Status of a Git Repository

- Never create a Git repository inside a Git repository.
- We can use `git status` to see if we are already in a Git repository.

### Setting Up a Git Repository

- **Initialising a New Repository**: Use `git init` to initialise a new Git repository in your project directory.
- **Cloning an Existing Repository**: Use `git clone [url]` to create a copy of an existing repository.

### Basic Git Workflow

- **Staging Changes**: Use `git add [file]` or `git add .` to stage changes for the next commit.
- **Committing Changes**: Use `git commit -m "[commit message]"` to save the staged changes with a descriptive message.
- **Viewing Status**: Use `git status` to see the status of changes in the repository.

### Understanding the Role of the Staging Area and Commit History

- **Staging Area**: A place where Git temporarily holds the changes you want to commit.
- **Commit History**: The record of all commits in the repository. Use `git log` to view the commit history.

### Using a `.gitignore` File

- There are files/folders that we donâ€™t want to store in our git repository (e.g. libraries, temporary files, personal settings, secrets).
- A `.gitignore` file allows users to specify patterns of files/folders that should never be added to the repository.
- `.gitignore` files are commonly found at the project root.

### Best Practices when Committing

- **Frequent Commits**: Make small, frequent commits to keep track of changes and make troubleshooting easier.
- **Meaningful Commit Messages**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages to document the purpose and content of each commit.

### Additional Basic Commands

- **Switching to a Branch**: Use `git switch [branch-name]` to switch to a different branch.
- **Pulling Changes**: Use `git pull` to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
- **Pushing Changes**: Use `git push` to send your committed changes to the remote repository.

## Section 4: Branching and Stashing

### Utilising Branches for Experimentation and Analysis

- **Creating a New Branch**: Use `git branch [branch-name]` to create a new branch.
- **Switching Branches**: Use `git switch [branch-name]` to move to a different branch.
- **Purpose of Branching**: Branching allows separate lines of development, ideal for experimenting with new features or data models.

### Branch Management

- **Listing Branches**: Use `git branch` to list all branches in the repository.
- **Deleting Branches**: Use `git branch -d [branch-name]` to delete a branch after its changes have been merged.
- **Merging Branches**: Use `git merge [branch-name]` to merge the changes from one branch into another.

### Stashing Changes

- **Using Git Stash**: Use `git stash` to temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to switch branches.
- **Applying Stashed Changes**: Use `git stash apply` to reapply the changes stored in the stash.
- **Stash Management**: Use `git stash list` to view stashed changes and `git stash drop` to remove a stash.

### Best Practices when Branching and Stashing

- **Regular Branching**: Create new branches for each new feature or significant change to keep the main branch stable.
- **Clean Working Directory**: Before switching branches, ensure the working directory is clean to avoid conflicts.
- **Stash Judiciously**: Use stashing for temporary changes that are not ready for a commit but need to be set aside.

## Section 5: Merging and Resolving Conflicts

### Merging Branches

- **Basic Merging**: Use `git merge [branch-name]` to combine the changes from one branch into another.
- **Fast-Forward Merge**: Occurs when there are no new commits on the base branch since you created your feature branch.
- **Three-Way Merge**: Used when there have been independent commits on both the feature branch and the base branch.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

- **Causes of Conflicts**: Conflicts occur when the same lines of code are changed differently in separate branches.
- **Identifying Conflicts**: Git will indicate a conflict during a merge. Conflicted files will be marked in the `git status` output.
- **Resolving Conflicts Manually**: Edit the conflicted files to resolve the differences, then `git add` the resolved files.

### Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for Conflict Resolution

- **VSCode as a Merge Tool**: VSCode provides a user-friendly interface for resolving merge conflicts with visual diff comparisons.
- **Resolving in VSCode**: Open the conflicted file in VSCode, choose the desired changes (either current or incoming), and save the file.
- **Committing the Merge**: After resolving conflicts, commit the merge with `git commit`.

### Best Practices when Merging

- **Regular Merges**: Regularly merge changes from the base branch into your feature branch to keep up-to-date and minimize conflicts.
- **Communication**: Coordinate with team members when merging shared branches to avoid conflicting changes.
- **Testing**: Test all changes locally after resolving conflicts and before committing the merge.

## Section 6: Using a Git GUI

### Introduction to GitKraken

- **GitKraken**: A popular Git graphical user interface (GUI) that simplifies Git commands into a visual experience.
- **Advantages for Beginners**: GitKraken provides an intuitive interface, making it easier for those new to Git to understand and use Git features.

### Basic Git Operations in GitKraken

- **Repository Management**: Easily clone, create, or add existing repositories.
- **Committing Changes**: Visualise changes, stage files, and commit them directly within the GUI.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create and merge branches using drag-and-drop functionalities.

### Visualising Branches and Commits

- **Commit Graph**: View a visual graph of the commit history, branches, and merges.
- **Interactive Rebase**: Perform interactive rebasing using a visual interface to clean up the commit history.

### Managing Repositories Using GitKraken

- **Remote Repositories**: Connect to remote repositories on platforms like GitHub for collaboration.
- **Pull Requests**: Create, manage, and merge pull requests directly within GitKraken.

### Advantages of Using a GUI

- **Enhanced Visualisation**: Easily visualise the structure of branches and commits, aiding in understanding complex Git operations.
- **Simplified Conflict Resolution**: Resolve merge conflicts with a more intuitive approach compared to command-line tools.
- **Workflow Streamlining**: Streamlines Git workflows, especially for managing large projects with many branches and commits.

### Best Practices when Using a GUI

- **Regular Backups**: Use GitKraken to regularly push changes to remote repositories as backups.
- **Branch Organization**: Leverage the visual interface to keep branches organised and avoid confusion.
- **Commit Regularly**: Use the easy interface to make regular commits, ensuring work is saved and documented.

## Section 7: Rebasing for a Clean Project History

### What is Rebasing and Why Use It?

- **Rebasing**: A process in Git that integrates changes from one branch into another. It's an alternative to merging.
- **Purpose**: Rebasing is used to maintain a linear project history by moving a feature branch to the tip of the main branch.

### Rebasing vs. Merging

- **Rebasing**: Rewrites history by placing commits from one branch onto the end of another branch, creating a linear sequence of commits.
- **Merging**: Combines the histories of two branches without altering existing commits, leading to a branching history.

### Performing a Rebase: `git rebase`

- **Basic Rebasing**: Use `git rebase [base-branch]` while on the feature branch to rebase it onto the base branch.
- **Interactive Rebasing**: Use `git rebase -i [base-branch]` for more control over the rebasing process, like squashing commits or reordering them.

### Resolving Conflicts during Rebasing

- **Conflict Resolution**: Similar to merge conflicts, rebase conflicts must be resolved manually before the rebase can continue.
- **Continuing a Rebase**: After resolving conflicts, use `git rebase --continue` to proceed with the rebase.

### Best Practices and Cautions

- **Avoid Rebasing Public History**: Rebasing should not be done on branches that are public and shared with others, as it rewrites history.
- **Use for Cleaning Up Local History**: Ideal for cleaning up and organising local commits before integrating them into a shared branch.
- **Test Before Pushing**: After a rebase, thoroughly test your project to ensure no issues were introduced during the rebase.

### Tips when Rebasing

- **Maintain Clean History**: Use rebase to maintain a clean, linear history for easier tracking and reviewing of data analysis changes.
- **Experimentation Branches**: Rebase branches for experimental analysis onto the main branch once the experiment is complete and you're ready to integrate the changes.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes on the changes made in each commit to aid in conflict resolution during rebasing.

## Section 8: Collaboration and Remote Repositories with GitHub

### Collaboration in Projects Using Git and GitHub

- **Importance of Collaboration**: Effective collaboration is key in large projects, often involving multiple stakeholders.
- **Role of Git and GitHub**: Git facilitates version control, while GitHub provides a platform for sharing and collaborating on code.

### Using GitHub as a Remote Repository

- **Remote Repositories**: Repositories hosted on GitHub that can be accessed by multiple users.
- **Adding a Remote Repository**: Use `git remote add origin [repository-URL]` to connect your local repository to GitHub.
- **Fetching and Pulling from Remote**: Use `git fetch` to fetch changes without merging, and `git pull` to fetch and merge changes.

### Creating READMEs

- **README Importance**: READMEs are essential documentation for your project. They provide an overview of your project's purpose, usage, and installation instructions.
- **Creating README Files**: You can create a README.md file in your repository to start documenting your project. Use Markdown syntax for formatting.
- **Content**: Include project title, description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information to help collaborators and users understand your project.

### Sharing Data Sets and Analysis via `push`, `pull`

- **Pushing Changes**: Use `git push` to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- **Pulling Changes**: Regularly pull updates from the remote to stay in sync with the team's progress.

### Cloning Repositories from GitHub

- **Cloning a Repository**: Use `git clone [repository-URL]` to make a local copy of a remote repository.
- **Benefits of Cloning**: Cloning is useful for contributing to an existing project or starting a new project based on an existing repository.

### Fetching Changes from GitHub

- **Fetching Updates**: Fetching is a Git operation used to retrieve changes from the remote GitHub repository without merging them into your local branch.
- **Purpose**: The main purpose of fetching is to bring your local repository up to date with the latest changes made by other collaborators.
- **`git fetch` Command**: To fetch changes, you can use the `git fetch` command. This command downloads new commits and updates references without merging them.

### Fetching vs. Pulling

- **Fetching**: Fetching is a safe operation that only downloads changes without merging. It gives you more control over when and how to merge the changes.
- **Pulling**: Pulling combines fetching and merging, making it more convenient for quick updates. However, it may lead to unexpected merge conflicts if not used carefully.
- **Use Cases**: Use fetching when you want to inspect changes before merging, and use pulling for quick updates when you are confident about merging.

### Best Practices when Collaborating Using GitHub

- **Regular Communication**: Keep the team informed about major changes or new branches.
- **Code Reviews**: Use GitHub's Pull Request feature for peer review of code changes.
- **Issue Tracking**: Utilise GitHub Issues to track tasks, enhancements, and bugs.

### Section 9: Git Workflows

#### Feature Branch Workflow

- **Overview**: Feature Branch Workflow is a Git workflow that encourages developers to create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- **Branch Creation**: Developers create feature branches from the main branch (usually `main` or `master`) for individual tasks.
- **Isolation**: Each feature branch isolates work on a specific feature, making it easier to collaborate without interfering with other features.
- **Pull Requests**: Developers open pull requests to merge their feature branches into the main branch after completing work.
- **Advantages**: Provides a structured approach to feature development and code review.

#### Trunk-Based Development

- **Overview**: Trunk-Based Development is a Git workflow where all development occurs on a single branch, often the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).
- **Continuous Integration**: Developers commit changes frequently to ensure continuous integration and testing.
- **Small Changes**: Encourages small, incremental changes to the codebase, reducing the risk of merge conflicts.
- **Release Branches**: Release branches are created when preparing for production releases.
- **Advantages**: Promotes rapid development, simplicity, and early conflict detection.

#### Gitflow Workflow

- **Overview**: Gitflow Workflow is a branching model that defines specific branch types and their purposes.
- **Branch Types**: Includes branches like `feature`, `hotfix`, `release`, `development`, and `main` (or `master`).
- **Feature Development**: Developers create feature branches from `develop`, complete their work, and merge back to `develop`.
- **Release Process**: Release branches are created from `develop` to prepare for production releases.
- **Hotfixes**: Hotfix branches allow for immediate bug fixes in production.
- **Advantages**: Provides a structured approach to release management and long-term development.

#### Choosing the Right Workflow

- **Considerations**: Selecting the right Git workflow depends on project size, team size, release frequency, and collaboration preferences.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Some teams may combine elements of different workflows to meet their specific needs.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that your team understands and follows the chosen workflow through clear documentation and training.
- **Adaptability**: Be open to adapting the workflow as the project evolves and requirements change.

#### Workflow Best Practices

- **Code Review**: Incorporate code review into all workflows to maintain code quality.
- **Continuous Integration**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployments.
- **Branch Naming**: Establish clear and consistent branch naming conventions.
- **Release Planning**: Plan releases, including versioning, tagging, and documentation updates.
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Use monitoring tools and metrics to assess the effectiveness of your workflow.

#### Collaborative Git Workflows

- **Team Collaboration**: Collaborate effectively within the chosen workflow by coordinating tasks and resolving conflicts.
- **Version Control for Workflow Definitions**: Store the definitions of your chosen workflow within your repository for collaborative updates.
- **Code Review for Workflow Definitions**: Apply code review practices to workflow definition files for quality assurance.

## Section 10: Undoing Changes, Exploring History, and Managing Versions

### Techniques to Undo Changes

- **Using `git reset`**: Reverts the repository to a previous state. `git reset --hard [commit]` discards all changes, while `git reset --soft [commit]` keeps the changes but undoes the commit.
- **Using `git revert`**: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in a specific commit, preserving the project history.

### Navigating Data Analysis History

- **Using `git log`**: Displays the commit history, allowing you to see who made changes and when.
- **Filtering the Log**: Use options with `git log`, like `--oneline`, `--graph`, or `--author`, to filter and format the output.

### Time Traveling in Repositories for Data Scripts

- **Switching to Past Commits**: Use `git switch --detach [commit-hash]` to view the state of the repository at a specific commit.
- **Caution**: Changing files in this state detaches the HEAD, creating a risk of losing changes.

### Using Tags for Versioning

- **Creating Tags**: Use `git tag [tag-name] [commit-hash]` to create annotated tags for significant versions, like releases or milestones.
- **Listing and Deleting Tags**: Use `git tag` to list all tags and `git tag -d [tag-name]` to delete a tag.

### Best Practices when Managing Changes

- **Commit Frequency**: Regularly commit changes with meaningful messages to maintain a clear project history.
- **Use Branches**: Make significant changes or experiments in separate branches to keep the main branch stable.
- **Tagging Key Points**: Use tags to mark important points in the project's history, like version releases or major changes.

## Section 11: Using Git Reflogs to Retrieve Lost Work

### Understanding the Functionality of Reflogs

- **Git Reflog**: A log of where the tips of branches and other references were in the past.
- **Usage**: Useful for recovering lost commits, viewing the history of reference updates, and undoing complex changes.

### Navigating the Reflog to Find Lost Commits

- **Viewing Reflogs**: Use `git reflog` to see a list of all actions that have changed the HEAD.
- **Identifying Lost Commits**: Each entry in the reflog shows a commit ID, allowing you to identify lost or orphaned commits.

### Recovering Deleted Branches and Commits

- **Restoring Deleted Branches**: Use the commit ID from the reflog to create a new branch from a deleted branch's last commit.
- **Recovering Lost Commits**: Check out the specific commit from the reflog and create a new branch from it.

### Practical Examples and Scenarios

- **Accidental Branch Deletion**: Use reflogs to find the last commit of the deleted branch and recreate it.
- **Undoing a Hard Reset**: If you've lost changes due to a hard reset, use reflog to find the previous HEAD and recover the changes.

### Best Practices when Working with Reflogs

- **Regular Check**: Periodically inspect the reflog to understand the history of changes in the repository.
- **Reflog as a Safety Net**: Remember that reflog is a local record, so it's best used as a safety net for local actions, not as a replacement for regular commits and backups.
- **Clean-Up Old Entries**: Reflog entries do eventually expire, so for very old recovery needs, consider other methods like backups.

## Section 12: Best Practices in Using Git

### Versioning Code and Data Separately

- **Code and Data Repositories**: Maintain separate repositories or branches for code and Data to manage changes independently.
- **Data Versioning Tools**: Consider using tools like DVC (Data Version Control) for handling large datasets.

### Handling Large Data Sets (Overview)

- **Git Limitations**: Git is not optimised for large files or binary data, which can lead to performance issues.
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**: Use Git LFS to manage and version large files within Git repositories efficiently.
- **External Storage**: Store large datasets in external data storage solutions and reference them in your Git repository.

### Maintaining Readable and Efficient History

- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes.
- **Atomic Commits**: Make small, single-purpose commits for easy tracking and reverting, if necessary.
- **Branching for Separate Analysis**: Use branches for different analyses or experiments, merging them back only when they're finalised and reviewed.

### Collaboration and Code Review

- **Regular Pull Requests**: Use pull requests to review code changes and ensure that new code fits well with the existing codebase.
- **Peer Reviews**: Actively participate in peer reviews to share knowledge and improve code quality.

### Documentation and Commenting

- **In-Code Documentation**: Document your code with comments to make it understandable to others (and your future self).
- **Readme Files**: Keep your repository's README updated with project information, setup instructions, and other relevant details.

### Continuous Learning and Improvement

- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest developments in Git (and GitHub) best practices.
- **Feedback and Adaptation**: Be open to feedback from peers and continuously adapt your practices for better efficiency and collaboration.

### Tips for Managing Data

- **Reproducibility**: Prioritise reproducibility by versioning not only code but also data and environment details.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use Git branches and tags to track different stages of experiments and analysis.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure regular backups of critical data, especially when dealing with irreplaceable datasets.
